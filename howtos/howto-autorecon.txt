# How to Use AutoRecon

AutoRecon is an automated reconnaissance tool designed for penetration testing and CTF challenges. It performs a series of scans and enumeration tasks to identify potential attack vectors.

---

## Setup

1. Ensure AutoRecon is installed in a virtual environment on your attacker machine:
   a. Activate the virtual environment:
      source ~/Desktop/tools/autorecon-venv/bin/activate

   b. AutoRecon is ready to use once activated.

2. Deactivate the virtual environment after you finish using AutoRecon:
   deactivate

---

## Usage

1. Run AutoRecon on a single target:
   autorecon <target-ip>

2. Run AutoRecon on a range of IPs:
   autorecon <start-ip>-<end-ip>

3. AutoRecon will create a `results` folder in the current directory, containing subfolders for each scanned IP address. Each folder includes:
   - Nmap results
   - Enumeration outputs (e.g., SMB, HTTP, FTP)
   - Bruteforce attempts

## Examples

### Scan a Single Target
autorecon 192.168.1.100

### Scan a Range of IPs
autorecon 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.105

### Save Results in a Custom Directory
Specify a custom directory to store results:
autorecon --output /path/to/custom-directory 192.168.1.100

## Tips

- **Run as Root**: Some scans require elevated privileges.
- **Use Custom Wordlists**: Specify your own wordlists for directory enumeration:
  autorecon --dirbuster-wordlist /path/to/wordlist.txt <target-ip>
- **Review Results**: Results are saved in structured directories. Pay attention to:
  - Open ports and services
  - Vulnerabilities identified in enumeration
  - Useful files and credentials
- **Combine with Manual Enumeration**: AutoRecon is a great starting point but doesnâ€™t replace manual testing.
